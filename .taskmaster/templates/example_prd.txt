### Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

#### 1. Product Overview

The goal of this project is to create a mobile application for tracking stock market data. This app will provide users with a real-time list of stocks, the ability to search for specific companies, and a feature to save their favorite stocks for easy monitoring.

#### 2. Goals & Success Metrics

The primary goal is to deliver a functional and user-friendly stock-tracking app. Success will be measured by the following criteria:

* The application successfully displays real-time stock data.
* Users can effectively search for stocks by name or ticker.
* The "Favorites" feature allows users to add, remove, and view their chosen stocks.
* The app's UI/UX accurately reflects the provided design.
* The codebase is clean, well-structured, and easy to expand upon.

#### 3. User Stories

**As a user, I want to...**

* ...view a list of stocks so I can see their current prices and daily changes.
* ...search for a specific company by its name or ticker to quickly find the stock I'm interested in.
* ...add a stock to a "Favorites" list so I can track it more easily.
* ...remove a stock from my "Favorites" list if I am no longer interested in it.
* ...view all my favorite stocks in a separate, dedicated tab.
* ...have my favorite stocks saved locally so they are still there when I reopen the app.

#### 4. Functional Requirements

* **Stock List Screen:** Display a scrollable list of stocks. Each list item must show:
    * Company Name
    * Stock Ticker
    * Current Price
    * Price Change (absolute value and percentage)
    * Company Logo
* **Search Functionality:** Implement a search bar that filters the main stock list. The search should work based on a company's name or its ticker symbol.
* **Favorites Feature:**
    * Add a visual indicator (e.g., a star icon) to each stock in the list.
    * Tapping the indicator should add or remove the stock from the user's favorites.
    * Create a separate "Favorites" tab or screen that only displays stocks the user has saved.
* **Local Data Persistence:** The list of favorite stocks must be saved locally on the device using a persistence solution (e.g., `UserDefaults`, `CoreData`, `Realm`, or `FileStorage`).

#### 5. Non-Functional & Technical Requirements

* **UI/UX:** The application's interface must closely match the provided design mockups. Smooth animations and transitions are highly desired.
* **Technology Stack:** The project must be built using **Swift** and **UIKit**. **SnapKit** should be used for programmatic UI layout.
* **API Integration:** The application must fetch real stock data from a free, public API using **URLSession**. The use of a live API is preferred over mock data and will be considered a strong positive.
* **Code Quality:** The code must be clean, well-documented, and follow standard Swift best practices. It should be designed for future extensibility and maintainability.
